# Dog Party

- The object of this assignment was to replicate two different pages using HTML and CSS. There were two screenshots of the pages provided and the goal was to write one HTML sheet and use two different CSS stylesheets to make the one HTML look very different. 

- I had to re-do my HTML three times in order to accomidate both comps. I'm glad that I did as it allowed me to get a fairly clear code base and the styling was much simpler because of it. 

- Things got a bit funky once Media Queries and JavaScript got involved. I attempted both and got parts of Media Queries working (not well) and I didn't get JavaScript working at all.
